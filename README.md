## Introduction:

The web application that I would like to build is an aggregator for the many media apps available. I would like to make a single pane of glass that can seamlessly connect to your different media apps like Reddit, Twitter, Spotify, YouTube, Twitch, Apple Podcast, etc... Any applications that can display you content. Want to allow them to be accessed from one single browser tab.

## Purpose:

The goal of this application would be to reduce the number of apps installed on your system and reduce the number of bookmarks needed to access your different media applications. Browsers are becoming absolute memory hogs, so the less tabs in a browser the better. With this there are a few security concerns, as this would be a single point of access to your many accounts. However, a solution to this would to either utilize app tokens that can be revoked in the event of account takeover. Or I will allow for the option to setup a view-only account. This would only use your app token to pull in feed information from the many applications. It would have no accessibility to manage your account in any way. My idea with this is to also make it an installable application that only has a UI, that interfaces with the web application via its API. As far as I know there is not an application that performs this action. There are social media managers for uploading specific content to all your social media platforms, but no aggregator for them like this. In theory I want this to be able to interface with nearly any media application.

## Version History:

This will be updated as commits are made to the repo including the changes that were made within each commit

## Issue Log:

This will be updated as issues are found with the application

## About me

I am a solo dev on this project, I am currently pursuing my bachelors in computer programming.

## Forward:

Since most media applications offer an API to interface with, I believe this is quite possible to achieve. I also have some longer-term goals with this project to possibly include some sort of machine learning. The goal with the addition of an AI is to build a curated feed of content from all your apps. This would be a nice and convenient way to consume content that you are most likely to enjoy.

## TLDR:

This application will be utilized for conglomerating all media applications into one web application.
